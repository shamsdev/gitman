# Gitman

A simple Bash script to expose Git repository operations as a RESTful API. This allows you to remotely monitor and update a Git repository through simple HTTP requests.

## Features

-   **Remote Git Operations:** Access Git functionalities like `log`, `branch`, and `pull` over a network.
-   **Secure:** Protects endpoints with a mandatory API key.
-   **Lightweight:** Written in pure Bash, with `nc` (netcat) as the only dependency for the server.
-   **Easy Configuration:** All settings are managed through a simple `.env` file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
-   `bash`
-   `git`
-   `nc` (netcat)

## Setup

1.  **Get the script:**
    Clone this repository or download the `gitman.sh` script.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gitman.git
    cd gitman
    ```

2.  **Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the sample file:

    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    ```

    Now, edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration:

    ```ini
    # Path to the local git repository you want to manage
    GIT_REPO_PATH="/path/to/your/repo"

    # The default branch to operate on
    GIT_BRANCH="main"

    # A secret key to authenticate API requests
    API_KEY="your-secret-api-key"

    # The port for the API server to listen on (optional, defaults to 8080)
    PORT=8080
    ```

## Usage

1.  Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x gitman.sh
    ```

2.  Run the server:
    ```bash
    ./gitman.sh
    ```

    If everything is configured correctly, you will see:
    ```
    üöÄ Gitman is running on http://localhost:8080
    üìÅ Repository: /path/to/your/repo
    üåø Branch: main
    Press Ctrl+C to stop.
    ```

## API Endpoints

All requests must include the `X-API-Key` header for authentication.

```bash
-H "X-API-Key: your-secret-api-key"
```
